\section*{Progress since last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finished basic code to find maximum activating samples.
    \item Started on draft of introduction.
    \item Set up nice CI for report.
    \item In general less progress than I would have liked.
    Mainly due to the revy and some personal stuff taking a lot of my time and energy.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continue exploring other work.
    \item Get SAE from somewhere (either pre-trained or self-trained) and get it to work.
    \item Get MAS for SAE.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Topics for meeting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Should I make the repo private? If so, I'll need a GitHub username to share it with.
    \item How much should I mention articles that are irrelevant for my own work, but are in the same area?
\end{itemize}
